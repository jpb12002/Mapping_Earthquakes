# Mapping Earthquakes with JS & APIs

## Purpose of Project
The task for this project was to build insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world. We also want to make the earthquake maps easy to use on desktop devices and mobile phones. We used the latest earthquake GeoJSON data from the US Geological Survey website.

## Results
